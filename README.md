This is an example of using a convolutional neural network(CNN) to predict the thermal conductivity of a graphene boron nitride composite structure，Here train.py program Contains data preparation functions for CNN processing such as obtaining image files, batch size, etc.The CNN structure used here includes 1 input layer, 4 convolutional layers, 3 pooling layers, 2 fully connected layers, and 1 output layer；Here we use part of the data in the data set to train the machine learning model, and then use the remaining part of the data to verify the accuracy of the model（by predict.py）.When evaluating the prediction accuracy of CNN model, we used MAE(Mean absolute error).
